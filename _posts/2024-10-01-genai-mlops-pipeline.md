In this post, I describe how I designed and deployed a Generative AI model pipeline with an MLOps approach using Azure Cloud. The pipeline automates data preprocessing, model training, and deployment. I used tools like Azure DevOps, Docker, and Kubernetes to streamline the CI/CD process.

Key points:
- **Automation**: How I automated model deployment with pipelines.
- **Scalability**: Leveraging Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) for scaling.
- **Monitoring**: Using Azure Monitor to track model performance.
